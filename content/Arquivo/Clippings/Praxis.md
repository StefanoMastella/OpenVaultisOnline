## Network States

Network States are supercharged internet communities that seek statehood, building economies, institutions, culture – and even cities. While early crypto adoption relied on speculative investment, future growth lies in practical applications—where Network States use onchain infrastructure to manage property, currency, contracts, and more.

The next wave of crypto adoption, on the path to crypto civilization, requires crypto infrastructure’s integration into the core functions of society. Network States provide the path.

## Praxian Way of Life

Inspired by the wisdom of great civilizations, we believe that true sovereignty is achieved through alignment with the transcendent. The Praxian way of life is driven by a vital energy that seeks transcendence through heroic action and contemplation. Our mission is to channel this drive into a cohesive way of life, forged by social structures and institutions that guide our people toward their destiny.
