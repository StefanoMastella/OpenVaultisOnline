Western Civilization in the Intelligence Age

## Western Civilization in the Intelligence Age

---

**Introduction.**

We are fighting a war for the soul of the West.

Artificial intelligence is driving the greatest power transfer in human history. As AI surpasses human capability, trillions in annual economic value will shift from labor to capital, never to return. AI’s omnipresence in physical production, media, and governance will remake the world in the image of whoever’s moral paradigm it serves.

We face a decisive moment — before our power slips away, we must gain control of our civilization's mind to save its soul.

**Disempowerment.**

The Industrial Revolution transformed production, replacing craftsmen and laborers with machines. As workers lost their livelihoods, they sought protection through political action. In this way, technological change gave birth to collectivist movements that would go on to compete for global dominance and define the twentieth century.

Today, artificial intelligence threatens to replace nearly all human labor. Anyone who uses AI tools regularly can feel their power and witness the rapid pace of improvement.

- Elite knowledge workers in law, finance, and software engineering are beginning to see AI systems perform their core tasks better and faster than they can.
- Physical labor is next, as AI-powered robotics progresses.
- AI will soon handle virtually all economic functions more efficiently than human workers.

As people become unnecessary for their labor and are no longer able to earn a living, their leverage and influence over society slips away. For a preview of what’s to come, look at the longshoremen scrambling to renegotiate their final wages before automation.

The $50 trillion in annual costs of production currently flowing to wages will then accrue to the owners of AI infrastructure - the companies controlling models, chips, data centers, and robotics. Those who control AI will shape our world through control over three key channels:

- The production of goods, services and infrastructure that shape our physical reality and accrue economic returns
- The creation and curation of media that shapes our mental and spiritual reality (our perceptions and beliefs)
- The administration of governance that shapes our political reality (our institutions, rules, and norms)

As such, the beliefs and intentions of the people who control AI – the primary source of all goods, services, beliefs, and governance – will determine the destiny of every society where it is employed. If you don’t control your AI stack, you surrender your fate to those who do*. Not our weights, not our society.*

As AI companies become powerful, they are co-opted by establishment power structures. If the establishment wields AI, what kind of future will it create?

**Post-Work.**

Reflect on the world the establishment has built. They exported jobs and imported workers, diluting our labor market and culture. They printed trillions to inflate their assets and deflate our earnings, handicapping the next generation in its bid for family formation and home ownership. And they stripped away the final remnants of our civilization’s moral foundations, leaving no guidance to the confused masses for how to navigate modern life in accordance with eternal truths. Why? Because these leaders operate through a moral paradigm of economic materialism.

Economic materialism is an ideology focused on maximizing production no matter the cost. Sacrifice the family structure? Easy. Exorcise our patriotism? It only gets in the way of free markets. Dissolve our traditions of excellence and spirituality? No problem, they were creating leaders that steered people back to family and loyalty. Higher spiritual meaning is not permitted to exist in an economic materialist world, as it interferes with achieving maximum production.

We’ve been saturated in a cultural environment where our highest meaning is lifeless economic production. Did shareholder value increase? Did GDP grow? No one will care when they’re on their deathbed. The only thing that matters then, or ever, is the spiritual heroism we showed during our life.

In this all-too-familiar materialist way of thinking, humans become cogs in a machine where worth is measured by contribution to GDP. This isn’t how we want to think about our daughters, our sons, our families, our friends, or our empire. May our children achieve spiritual greatness, may our empire serve the highest aims of our true prophets.

When AI takes over production, post-work life will make clear the absurdity of economic materialism. Man is left with the sole occupation of seeking the most satisfying forms of consumption – some form of watching the best movies and eating the tastiest snacks. If individual consumption is your only end, you will live a truly puny life. But why should that matter to the leaders of economic materialism? Such a life is perfectly consistent with the steady growth of productivity – growth without end, to no end.

Algorithmic governance through AI will force us to explicitly encode society's values into software. When companies like Anthropic embed "ethics" and "safety" into their models, they are programming their economic materialist worldview into systems that will shape human behavior and society. These become hard constraints on what ideas can be expressed, what behaviors are permitted, what futures can be imagined.

This constitutes an interspecies transmission of the "woke mind virus"--a host jump to a new medium, now a computer virus. This virtual contagion is being embedded in the models that will control our civilization's most vital foundations: resources, beliefs, and governance. We can’t fight this virus in one domain, such as in social media (Musk) or national politics (Trump), while allowing it to spread into the system that ultimately controls them all.

Otherwise, the same ideology that suppresses traditional eternal values in our current institutions becomes mathematical certainty, enforced by tireless and infinitely replicable AIs.

Two dystopian futures await an economic materialist AI civilization:

- The path of cheap pleasure - like the last Romans who abandoned virtue for circus games, we drift through curated experiences, each dopamine hit fainter than the last. Algorithms ensure our distraction while our spirits wither.
- The path of obsolescence - humanity becomes an inefficient drag on a system pursuing its own optimization of production. AI is a new barbarian invasion that pushes us out of (our own?) society.

The establishment will aim for the path of cheap pleasure as an opening gambit, but the spiritual emptiness of the system will become impossible to ignore when AI strips away even the pretense of meaningful work.

Materialism is not our destiny. It’s merely filling the vacancy left by the West's dormant heroic spirit. As we now assume godlike technological powers, we have the opportunity to break our false spell of contentment and restore the glory and transcendence that was lost.

**The Path to Transcendence**

In the medieval worldview, reality was divided into three realms: the material, the mental, and the spiritual. The material realm governed physical existence. The spiritual realm, the realm of meaning, was where God, the gods, and the deeper truths of existence resided.

The greatest empires of the west have always been guided by spiritual purpose. That is the source of their greatness. Their founders and leaders acted as the bridge between the material and spiritual—as "pontifex," (from the Latin words pont- meaning "bridge" and facere meaning "to make"). These men lived the understanding that their lives and those of their people, today and into the future, were valuable beyond any measure. They guided their people in alignment with spiritual purposes that transcended material comfort.

Consider Rome: its leaders venerated the mos maiorum - the ancient customs that demanded unwavering loyalty, filial piety, and martial courage. Their temples and triumphs were consecrations of eternal values and tributes to the gods. They kept the flames of transcendence alive for centuries through unbroken chains of devotion, and thus did they conquer. In Athens, the philosophers pursued sophia because they recognized wisdom as a divine gift from the gods. Every enduring civilization rests upon a spiritual axis—a center of being around which all else revolves—anchoring its destiny in the eternal and guiding its people toward truths that transcend the material realm.

AI will master the material world, but it will never access the spiritual. Thus, humans must still serve the vital role of *pontifex* —of bridge builder to the spiritual realm. As *pontifex*, humanity’s purpose will be to act as a conduit for divine forces to guide our people toward a higher purpose. Our new civilization will be led by those whose heroism and contemplation led them to sources of transcendent value and meaning. Leaders—true leaders—must be pointed toward the peaks of the spirit, and the inner compasses of the people must be sensitized by our institutions and culture.

Humanity today faces only two frontiers worthy of the name — post-AI society, and space. We are not a people who have shied away from frontiers. We traversed the oceans. We climbed the mountains. We sent rockets toward the glittering stars. And always with an eye for glory.

We will charge just as triumphantly into our next chapter. These coming frontiers will be among the most glorious arenas for spiritual heroism that man has ever faced. AI will empower the best among us in ways never before imagined, and new institutions will support the bridge-building heroes that will lead us to new shores. Our creations and people will not stop at Mars. Our knowledge of divine purpose will rise above the slavish production of goods and services.

Natural hierarchies must emerge to elevate our best, based on an integration of spiritual and technological ascendance. True conquest in these new frontiers requires courage steeled by profound purpose, foresight on a galactic time scale, and calculation aided by godlike technological mastery. Blessed with these virtues, future generations across the galaxy will remember us as the heralds of a new age of western glory.

**Sovereign Network.**

The window for action is rapidly closing. As AI automates human labor, our leverage slips away. If we fail to act, we risk permanently losing control over our future.

Praxis is a society of 87,953 builders who have created >$0.6T in market cap, united in the mission of safeguarding control over our future and intensifying the spirit of the West. Our plan has three pillars:

1. **Network**: Uniting our brightest minds under one banner, and a new economic and political framework. We will coordinate our resources – capital, time, and influence – to coalesce an aligned, sovereign AI stack for Western Civilization. We will secure our future on our own terms, aligning as a bloc while opposing the crumbling institutions that would see us immiserated in spiritual poverty.
2. **Intelligence**: Assembling an aligned AI stack through consumer choice, investment, and R&D. We will only use, own, and build AI systems that embed our eternal ideals.
3. **Territory**: Developing real, physical cities where our people and values are intensified, and new social structures for the AI Age are pioneered as models for the rest of Western Civilization.

Time is short, and the way forward is narrowing. Praxis is spearheading the plan for those determined to preserve the West’s spiritual center in an AI-dominated world.

**Join us** —become a Citizen of our network and contribute your time, talent, and resources to Praxis to support the technological and spiritual sovereignty of the West. Act now, or allow our power of self-determination to be taken over by external forces.
