## Frequently asked questions

Frequently asked questions ordered by popularity.

What is Techno-Optimism and why is it important?

Techno-optimism is the belief that technology will lead to significant positive and sustainable changes in society, solving global issues and improving quality of life through innovation.It is important because it encourages a shift from an excessive focus on traditional political solutions—such as laws, taxation, and regulations—to innovation-oriented governance that leverages the iterative approaches of startups. While technology doesn’t solve all problems, a culture that rejects its power as a central strategy to progress is doomed to poverty and social turmoil.

Can I bring my kids?

Absolutely. We believe the future of cities should embrace the vibrant energy of children and expose them to innovation, AI, and other powerful technologies from the beginning. We’ll offer several activities for families and kids.

How much does it costs?

You can check the prices on the [Documentation](https://docs.ipe.city/ipe-village-floripa/pricing), Pricing section. Every 2 weeks the price increases 5% until the start of the event.

How will accommodation work?

Residents are responsible for booking hotel or Airbnb accommodations. We strongly recommend booking a place near [Founder Haus](https://maps.app.goo.gl/342MtGpnH4bZ7GQH6) in Jurere International, within a maximum 10-minute walk.

Can I stay less than one month?

Yes, but we are prioritizing those who are staying at least 3 weeks as an Ipê Architect, i.e, residents who will prototype and showcase solutions during the pop-up.
