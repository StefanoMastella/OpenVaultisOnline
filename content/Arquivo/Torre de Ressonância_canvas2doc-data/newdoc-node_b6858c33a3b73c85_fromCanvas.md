remember that time Microsoft created a
0:09
version of Windows that completely did
0:11
away with the desktop
0:13
metaphor the icons menus pointers when
0:16
they replace the hierarchical file
0:17
system with something more intuitive and
0:20
fluid something that naturally flows the
0:22
way our thoughts flow that helps us map
0:24
our thoughts rather than Force our
0:26
thoughts to conform to its
0:28
structure remember windows
0:31
color I do but you don't and that's
0:34
because none of that's real it was a
0:35
dream I had about 10 years ago but that
0:38
dream got me thinking one thought led to
0:40
another and I ended up thinking not just
0:41
about user interface design but about
0:43
the nature of interfaces the nature of
0:45
metaphors it got metaphysical it got
0:48
mystical it bled into thoughts about the
0:50
structure of the universe and it
0:52
culminated with me writing a book called
0:54
Libra Indigo the affordances of magic
0:56
I'll explain why I called it that later
0:59
let's start with talking about a company
1:00
you've probably not thought about in a
1:02
very long time or ever if you're young
1:03
enough I'm talking about Xerox they make
1:06
copy machines you just seen the Xerox
1:09
914 copier but let's pretend they never
1:13
made a single copy machine even taking
1:15
that out of the picture the thing
1:16
they're best known for they still change
1:18
the world and they did that by inventing
1:21
the desktop interface I'd like to
1:24
introduce you to the Xerox 810 star
1:26
information system this is a new
1:29
computer designed designed for office
1:30
professionals on the screens are small
1:33
pictures or icons representing familiar
1:35
office objects this graphical user
1:38
interface or GUI came from xerox's Palo
1:40
Alto Research Center or park and The
1:42
Surreal thing about this demo is you see
1:44
someone introducing the primary Concepts
1:47
behind the desktop metaphor to people
1:49
who hadn't yet internalized these
1:50
Concepts as just the obvious way to
1:52
interact with the computer we call this
1:54
the desktop it is an electronic analog
1:57
for an office this turned black because
1:59
because I pointed to it with the mouse
2:01
and clicked the mouse button we call
2:03
this selecting the object the copy
2:05
command is also a powerful when in Star
2:09
it establishes a paradigm for creating
2:12
the enlarged form is called the window
2:14
every icon has its own window this is a
2:17
document window displaying the contents
2:19
of a document filing is done by moving
2:22
an icon into or out of a file drawer
2:25
these are electronic analogs of the
2:26
drawers in an office filing cabinet it's
2:29
like watching someone explain gravity to
2:31
someone who's never lived on
2:36
earth watching this demo forces us out
2:39
of the notion that the desktop is just
2:40
the natural de facto method of
2:42
interacting with the computer it feels
2:44
like being a fish that has just been
2:46
informed that it swims in water and
2:48
we're like wait what's water because for
2:51
us water is just the default ambient
2:53
background hum of reality and here's
2:55
where I'll warn you that this video
2:57
series is going to do more than just
2:58
walk you through the history of graphic
2:59
iCal user interfaces we're going to talk
3:01
about dreams we're going to talk about
3:03
metaphysics and the reality that our
3:04
five senses hide from us we're going to
3:06
talk about Newtonian physics einsteinian
3:08
physics and quantum physics and Carl
3:10
Yung synchronicity mysticism the occult
3:13
so if you have no tolerance for that
3:15
stuff you may want to get off the ride
3:16
after this first video and if you are
3:18
interested in all that stuff hang in
3:20
there for this video because that's
3:21
where we're headed and now back to our
3:24
story I want to back up here a bit and
3:27
talk about the predecessors of Xerox
3:29
parks graphical user interface because
3:31
although they invented the desktop and
3:32
coined the term graphical user interface
3:34
there was a guy in the 60s named Ivan
3:36
southernland who built a graphical
3:38
interface as part of his PhD program at
3:41
MIT we're going to show
3:43
you a man actually talking to a computer
3:48
in a way far different than it's ever
3:50
been possible to do before surely not
3:53
with his voice no he's going to be
3:56
talking graphically he's going to be
3:57
drawing and the computer's going to
4:00
understand his drawings it was called
4:02
sketch pad and it used a light pen to
4:04
draw and manipulate shapes on an
4:06
oscilloscope screen Ivan Southerland was
4:08
a true Visionary not only did he create
4:10
this completely revolutionary
4:11
interaction modality but he created an
4:14
augmented reality prototype in
4:18
1968 then there was the mouse which was
4:21
demoed in this Stanford Research
4:22
Institute presentation also from 1968
4:25
this is Douglas engelbart and the way
4:27
the tracking spot moves and conjunction
4:30
with movements of that Mouse I don't
4:33
know why we call it a mouse sometimes I
4:35
apologize it started that way and we
4:38
never did change it and then in 1982
4:40
Xerox realized that the computer-based
4:42
office would eventually eradicate the
4:44
need for paper which would eradicate the
4:46
need for their product copy machines so
4:49
they hired like 50 computer Engineers
4:52
gave them almost unlimited resources and
4:54
no real limitations and let them do
4:55
their thing but researchers at Park
4:58
could never persuade zero management
5:00
that their Vision was accurate head
5:02
office in New York ignored the
5:03
Revolutionary Technologies they own
5:05
3,000 M away these guys had never
5:08
fantasized about what the future of the
5:10
office was going to be and when it was
5:12
presented to them they had no mechanisms
5:15
for turning those ideas into real life
5:17
product and yet the vision was getting
5:19
created every day within the the palalo
5:21
research center and there was no one to
5:24
receive that Vision so they had
5:25
technical Vision but not enough
5:27
commercial or marketing Vision to bring
5:29
it to the Mass
5:30
then Along Comes A man who did have
5:33
those things hi I'm Steve Jobs in
5:36
December 1979 jobs then all of 24 had a
5:40
privileged invitation to visit Xerox
5:43
Park and they showed me really uh three
5:46
things I was so blinded by the first
5:49
thing they showed me which was the
5:50
graphical user interface I thought it
5:53
was the best thing i' had ever seen in
5:54
my life within you know 10 minutes it
5:58
was obvious to me that all computers
6:00
would work like this and the then head
6:03
of the science center asked me to give
6:06
the demo because Steve specifically
6:08
asked for me to give the demo and I said
6:10
no way I had a big argument with the
6:14
Xerox Executives telling them that they
6:16
were about to give away the kitchen sink
6:19
I said I would only do it if I were
6:21
ordered to do it cuz then it course
6:23
would be their responsibility and that's
6:25
what they did introducing Macintosh it
6:29
does all the things you'd expect a
6:30
business computer to do the 1984
6:33
Macintosh may have popularized the GUI
6:36
but when Microsoft and IBM partnered and
6:38
released Windows 3.0 in 1990 that's when
6:42
the desktop became the household and
6:43
workplace
6:45
standard now in the middle of all this
6:47
was a guy who although he was a computer
6:49
scientist who worked for a bunch of
6:50
different universities and tech
6:51
companies came from a creative
6:53
counterculture arts background this guy
6:56
is named Ted Nelson first of all this is
6:59
the
7:00
most self-referentially smug
7:05
conference that I have been at outside
7:08
apple and IBM he invented the term
7:10
hypertext Ted Nelson knows all the ins
7:13
and outs of the history of Silicon
7:14
Valley and he tells all in his book
7:16
Geeks bearing gifts and in my opinion
7:19
he's one of the most important kudin on
7:21
the planet the icons and windows was
7:24
were just a fig leaf on the conventional
7:26
operating system they didn't change the
7:28
operating system in any way they just
7:30
hid it they dumbed on the computer
7:32
making it a paper simulator and in a FTI
7:33
and bargain gave us the sensual
7:36
pleasures of f of fonts in return for
7:38
giving up any forms of connection in
7:41
order to sell
7:42
printers they threw away the
7:44
universe what frustrates Ted Nelson so
7:47
much and what makes him so salty is that
7:49
at 87 years old as of this video he
7:52
still Grieves so deeply for a future
7:54
that never came his heart is broken by
7:57
the fact that the world took the desktop
7:59
met for too literally instead of using
8:01
the machine to emancipate us from the
8:03
organizational structures of the office
8:05
we just implemented those structures
8:07
into the machine instead of using the
8:09
screen to liberate us from the four
8:11
sides of a flat sheet of paper we just
8:13
made an electronic version of paper this
8:16
is what he still screams from the
8:18
rooftops today paper enforces single
8:22
sequence it imposes a particular kind of
8:26
order in the very nature of the
8:27
structure when I saw the computer
8:30
I said at last we can escape from the
8:33
prison of paper and that was what my
8:35
whole hypertext idea was about in 1960
8:38
and since what did the other people
8:40
do they imitated paper which to me seems
8:45
totally insane here's a quote of his I
8:48
include in the book hierarchy is the
8:50
official metaphysic of the computer
8:51
World today's hierarchical computer
8:54
tools impose hierarchy where it may not
8:56
exist they can model the hierarchical
8:58
aspects of the world world but not the
9:00
vital remainder they teach beginners
9:02
that it's the necessary structure of
9:04
computers and the universe so to to us
9:07
you appear to be the only one around
9:10
Miss clinically
9:12
sane no one has ever said that
9:16
before usually I hear the the
9:21
opposite I used to work for a company
9:23
that's specialized in developing virtual
9:25
and augmented reality interfaces and the
9:27
major frustration for All The
9:28
Visionaries in that company was seeing
9:30
how all the apps that were being
9:31
developed for those 3D systems were
9:33
basically just bringing 2D into a 3D
9:36
environment there was nothing
9:37
revolutionary happening the interaction
9:39
modality is exactly the same there are
9:41
just more screens everyone with even a
9:44
drop of visionary blood in them knows
9:45
there's a better way to deal with
9:47
information and with augmenting the
9:48
human mind but no one has figured it out
9:50
yet in a way that will just snap into
9:52
the Public's Consciousness the way the
9:54
GUI did in the early 80s the company I
9:56
worked for was full of interface
9:58
designers and it's there that I learned
10:00
the term affordances this term was
10:01
coined by the psychologist JJ Gibson to
10:04
describe what the environment provides
10:06
or affords an entity as an interaction
10:08
modality so a branch affords a sloth the
10:12
ability to hang the word acquired
10:14
additional meaning in the world of human
10:15
machine interaction after being
10:17
appropriated by the design Professor Don
10:19
Norman who's a big deal in the world of
10:21
design every designer has his book The
10:23
Design of Everyday Things he uses the
10:25
word affordances to describe elements of
10:27
technology that directly interface with
10:29
with people a door knob affords us the
10:31
ability to open the door icons afford US
10:34
the ability to open files and here's why
10:37
I name this video rotating the cube of
10:39
reality when designers work with 3D
10:41
Graphics they need to be able to
10:43
interact with all facets of a shape the
10:45
convention of 3D design programs is for
10:47
gizmos to materialize when a virtual
10:49
object like a cube is selected gizmos
10:52
are like handles that let you move and
10:54
rotate a cube before the Gizmo appears
10:57
the cube just looks like a square but
10:58
using the r at Gizmo enables the user to
11:01
manipulate it and reveal its hidden
11:03
geometry in my book and in this video
11:05
series we'll use the term affordances to
11:07
refer to conceptual handles we can use
11:09
to reveal the hidden aspects of ideas
11:12
one very powerful and common affordance
11:15
is metaphor and remember icons are
11:17
visual metaphors the entire desktop is
11:19
made of metaphors and these visual
11:21
metaphors are the affordances of the
11:23
user interface that pretty much every
11:25
personal computer leans on the concern
11:27
that Ted Nelson and I both both have
11:29
with the desktop interface is that its
11:31
metaphors lead us to an extremely
11:33
limited thought process a thought
11:35
process built on the hierarchy of
11:37
folders a thought process stunted by a
11:39
lack of visible conceptual connection
11:41
between related ideas that are siloed
11:43
off in separate files a structure that's
11:46
unnecessarily flattened into 2D not only
11:49
does the GUI as we know it not reflect
11:51
the way we think but it shapes the way
11:53
we think in limiting ways the book
11:56
metaphors we live by by Loff and Johnson
11:58
elaborates on the the ways that
11:59
metaphors shape our world they're
12:01
conceptual affordances that we are
12:03
utterly steeped in so we should be more
12:05
mindful of which metaphors we use here's
12:07
a quote from the book metaphors May
12:10
create realities for us especially
12:11
social realities a metaphor May thus be
12:14
a guide for a future action such actions
12:16
will of course fit the metaphor this
12:18
will in turn reinforce the power of the
12:20
metaphor to make the experience coherent
12:23
in this sense metaphors can be
12:25
self-fulfilling
12:26
prophecies this sort of Echoes the media
12:28
Theory Marshall mclin's ideas about how
12:30
the media we use to convey things
12:32
whether it's books or music or
12:34
television the structure of the media
12:36
itself is just as important if not more
12:39
important than whatever actual content
12:41
the media is delivering his most famous
12:43
book and his most famous saying is the
12:46
medium is the
12:48
message there's a quote that's often
12:50
misattributed to mclan it was actually a
12:52
friend of his who said it we shape our
12:54
tools and thereafter our tools shape Us
12:58
in the next video we'll talk about how
12:59
the conceptual affordances we use to
13:01
communicate ideas shape our reality and
13:04
how they create a flattened version of
13:06
reality that conceals the true nature of
13:08
the universe as Ted Nelson put it they
13:10
didn't change the operating system in
13:12
any way they just hid it this is the
13:15
first in a series of videos in which I
13:16
take you through the themes of the book
13:18
from start to finish you should still
13:19
read it you can get it on Amazon or
