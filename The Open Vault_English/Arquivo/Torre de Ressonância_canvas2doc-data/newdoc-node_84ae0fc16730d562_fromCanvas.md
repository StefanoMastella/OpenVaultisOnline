A 2023 systematic review in _Noise Control Engineering Journal_ reveals that environmental noise exposure above 60 dB (Lden) significantly impacts health, increasing cardiovascular disease risk by 8% for every 10 dB increment.

The study, analyzing global data from urban and industrial settings, found insomnia prevalence rises by 25% and stress hormone levels (e.g., cortisol) increase by 15% among exposed populations.

Chronic exposure to 70 dB is linked to a 9% higher stroke risk, while prolonged noise levels of 75 dB correlate with a 14% elevation in hypertension incidence.

Additionally, cognitive function declines by 12% under noisy conditions, and sleep quality drops by 20% due to fragmented REM cycles.

Biohackers can leverage acoustic mitigation strategies to counteract these effects, potentially enhancing longevity and mental resilience.
