Between April 22 and May 22, a new parallel city was founded within Florianópolis, the Magical Island. Introducing Ipê City: a pop-up city in Jurerê. Brilliant minds from around the world gathered to prototype and experiment with new forms of societal organization. We're developing open-source innovations and testing novel models of distributed autonomous organizations—the people, mechanisms, and AI entities that will form the foundation of future Network States. Freedom and Integration are our guiding ideals. Beyond code and blueprints, Ipê City serves as a crucible for forging lasting friendships, sparking innovative ideas, and exploring profound philosophical questions. Join the conversation and help us shape the future of decentralized living!
