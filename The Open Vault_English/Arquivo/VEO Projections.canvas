		{"id":"d4416bc178fcf787","type":"text","text":"Create a short animated video based on the provided image, transforming it into a dynamic scene while preserving the exact environment and appearance of all spheres. The scene is viewed from inside a futuristic spaceship chamber or dome, presenting a holographic or augmented reality display. The spheres, representing architectural projects from an office, float gently in place with subtle, slow movements such as slight rotations or minor bobbing, without changing their sizes, positions relative to each other, textures, reflections, or contents. Maintain a fixed camera angle with very little to no camera movement, focusing on the serene floating motion of the spheres in the curved, dome-like space. Ensure the overall aesthetic remains identical to the original image, with glowing labels like 'Echo Chamber' and 'Harmonic Grid' visible, in a high-tech, ethereal atmosphere.","x":1802,"y":-1300,"width":378,"height":229},
