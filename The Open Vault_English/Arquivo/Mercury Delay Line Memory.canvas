In fact, the radar was designed during that era, so it is no surprise. Our IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) secondary radar had a whopping 1 kilobyte of magnetic core memory in its processor circuitry. It consisted of 1024 tiny toroids mounted in a square matrix with four hair-width enamel coated wires running through them as x and y magnetization current lines, sense, and inhibit functions. If my memory serves me (pun intended) after three decades away from it, the TTL circuitry (no microprocessor) stored range values to calculate speed and direction from sample to sample. The other memory type was a mercury acoustic delay line contraption having a piezoelectric transducer at one end to launch an electrical pulse along its length and another transducer at the other end to convert back to an electrical pulse. It was used to cancel out stationary targets (clutter) as part of the MTI (moving target indication) circuitry in our precision approach radar (PAR).\n\nThe Electronic Mind - How it Remembers\n\n[![Magnetic core memory consisting of small ferrite rings - RF Cafe](https://www.rfcafe.com/references/popular-electronics/images4/electronic-magnetic-memory-core-popular-electronics-august-1956-1_small.jpg)](https://www.rfcafe.com/references/popular-electronics/images4/electronic-magnetic-memory-core-popular-electronics-august-1956-1.jpg)\n\nClose-up of magnetic core memory consisting of small ferrite rings retaining information imparted through pulses from the wire network.\n\nBy H. H. Fantel, Associate Editor\n\nMan's machines are doing the work of his muscles ... now, electronics explores ways to take the load off his mind\n\nWhen I was about five years old, I always carried a piece of string in my pocket. I used to tie knots in it to remind myself of things I shouldn't forget. Without knowing it at the time, I had, in effect, developed a \"machine mind.\" To be sure, it wasn't capable of very fine mental distinctions. But it could tell the difference between yes and no. A knot meant \"yes\" (= there is something I ought to do). No knot meant \"no\" (= relax and do nothing).\n\nToday's digital computers use essentially the same system. Instead of a string, there is a wire. Instead of a knot, there is a voltage pulse. Otherwise, it's the same. The pulse means: go ahead and do something. No pulse means: rest.\n\nIn the language of computer engineers, each \"pulse\" or each \"no-pulse\" is called a \"bit,\" because each represents one specific bit of information. Together, and arranged in logical sequence, billions of bits make up the complex patterns which direct the computers toward the solution of a problem. Yet everything the machine needs to know is broken down into simple yes-or-no propositions. \"Pulse\" or \"no-pulse\" is all that any part of the machine ever needs to distinguish, all it ever needs to remember. The computer's memory is therefore a device for storing electrical pulses in predetermined patterns.\n\n[![Basic components of a Univac computer - RF Cafe](https://www.rfcafe.com/references/popular-electronics/images4/electronic-magnetic-memory-core-popular-electronics-august-1956-2_small.jpg)](https://www.rfcafe.com/references/popular-electronics/images4/electronic-magnetic-memory-core-popular-electronics-august-1956-2.jpg)\n\nOver-all view of the basic components of a Univac computer.

As the names imply, the external memory is a sort of auxiliary, tacked onto the central computer mechanism. The internal memory is located right within the works of the computer.\n\nThe external memory acts as a go-between for the machine and its human masters. It remembers the instructions given to the computer' by human mathematicians. By setting up the external memory, scientists can \"program\" the computer to do a given job. This memory also acts as a sort of \"time transformer\" to match the slow speed of human beings to the high speed of the machine. Scientists might take days to punch a set of instructions into the external memory. Later, the memory can reel out this row of instructions fast enough to keep up with a computer when it zooms through the whole problem.\n\nPhysically, the external memory takes the form of punched cards, magnetic tape, or punched paper tape.\n\nPunched cards and paper tape have long been in use with conventional office equipment as data storage media - punched-card tabulating equipment, for example, has become commonplace in American business, and the paper-tape-driven automatic typewriter has relieved many a typist of repetitive labor. The data storage principle in each of these cases is extremely simple: information is recorded on the card or tape in the form of punched holes. A hole means an electric pulse; no hole, no pulse. Because of the wide use of these storage devices, some computers have been equipped with punched-card and punched-tape readers, and a number of machines have been developed to convert these media automatically to magnetic tape.\n\nIn magnetic tape storage, the most commonly used form of external storage for the electronic computer, characters are represented by combinations of tiny magnetized and unmagnetized spots, each representing a \"bit\" of information. When data recorded on the tape is fed into the computer, the magnetic tape reader translates the combination of magnetized and non-magnetized spots to a series of electronic pulse/no pulse combinations which, in computer language, have a definite meaning.\n\nThe great advantage of magnetic tape over other external memory devices is its tremendous capacity. One reel of magnetic tape, eight inches in diameter and one-half inch wide, can store approximately 2,880,000 characters, with up to 200 characters recorded per linear inch. The tape will preserve data permanently and will not corrode. It can be \"erased\" and used again for new data.\n\nThe machine uses its internal memory in the same way that human beings use scratch pads in solving a math problem. It is a place to put down intermediate results and the auxiliary numbers in the course of a calculation. Since such figures - in the form of electronic pulses - must be quickly jotted down, stashed away, or shifted from one place to another, some very tricky mechanisms were developed to do all this juggling of \"bits.\" Mainly, they are storage devices permitting information bits to be quickly put in, quickly taken out, and accurately placed in a meaningful over-all pattern.\n\n**Electrostatic Storage.** These storage devices are cathode-ray tubes resembling picture tubes in television sets. The screen of such a tube acts like a checkerboard of small capacitors. Whenever the \"writing beam\" of the tube hits one of the \"squares\" on this checkerboard, its capacitor effect stores up an electric charge imparted to it by the beam. The guided beam places a pattern of charged and uncharged areas on the checkerboard screen. Each area is a \"bit,\" and the arrangement of the bits on the board spells out a numerical meaning. This pattern of electrostatic charges can be \"read\" by another beam scanning the area.\n\nInformation stored in such a way can be reached very quickly. It only takes between five- and ten-millionths of a second to \"read out\" a digit of information and shift it to wherever it is needed for the next logical operation of the computer. Because the computer must spend much of its operating time searching its memory for data and instructions, the speed of access to specific information largely determines the over-all speed of the system.\n\nThe storage capacity of a single tube is limited usually to about 1000 bits. Tubes can, of course; be used in combination to form large-capacity storage units.\n\nOne disadvantage of electrostatic storage is that the data are lost from the tube's surface unless they are constantly regenerated by the writing beam. In other words, the machine has to keep talking to itself to remember what it is saying. Although this is done entirely by automatic circuitry, the stored data are lost in the event of a power failure.\n\nA certain unreliability stems from the fact that beam guidance is highly critical. A small temporary voltage change on the deflection plates can direct the beam to the wrong checkerboard area on the face of the tube, resulting in false information. Frequent adjustment by engineering personnel is essential for operating reliability.\n\n**Electro-Acoustic Delay Line.** One of the first memory systems to gain wide commercial acceptance for electronic computers was the electro-acoustic delay line. In simplest terms, a delay line memory stores electronic data by constantly recirculating the information pulse pattern in the form of sound through a delay element, usually a tank of mercury. At the precise moment when the information must be inserted into the calculation, it is picked up by a \"listening\" device at the far end of the tank and transferred to where it is needed. The memory tank can then stop mumbling to itself.\n\nThe process may be likened to the short-range human device of repeating a phone number to oneself from the time it is located in the phone book until it has been dialed.\n\nA mercury delay line memory channel consists simply of a mercury tank capped at each end by a transducing crystal, and a closed recirculation circuit. As pulses are delivered to the memory from the computer's control circuits, the crystal at one end acts as a sort of loudspeaker and sends a series of pulse/no-pulse tones through the mercury. These pulses thus travel through the mercury at the speed of sound, much lower than the speed of electronic pulses through wire. This provides the delay needed to hold information for controlled lengths of time.\n\nAs the pulses reach the end of the mercury column, they strike the second transducing crystal - which acts as a microphone - and produce small electrical voltages that can be amplified and fed back to the input. In this way, the bits continually go in circles until they are replaced by other data from the control circuits. Then the whole cycle starts anew.\n\nEach tank has automatic counting devices, which count the number of times a message is repeated. This provides accurate timing within a few thousandths of a second for picking up the message when it is needed.\n\n**Magnetic Drum Storage.** The magnetic drum is an aluminum cylinder or \"drum\" coated with a magnetic material and equipped with a row of read-write heads. As the drum spins at high speed, each head monitors a narrow \"track\" around the circumference.\n\nWhen data are to be stored, the pulse combinations are flashed to the heads and are recorded in the form of magnetized and unmagnetized areas on the drum's surface. The operation is very much like recording data on a broad, endless loop of tape with many channels.\n\nAn important advantage of magnetic drums is their capacity; such drums are made to hold as many as 2,552,000 bits, or about 350,000 characters. Other favorable features are their .low cost and the fact that they retain stored data indefinitely.\n\n**Magnetic Core Memory.** In recent years, pure physical research has opened up new horizons through the discovery of a new basic material: the ferrites. Their impact on electronics is a whole story in itself. Here we are concerned only with their possibilities as memory devices.\n\nMagnetic polarity can be established in ferrites by a current of sufficient strength. Once established, the magnetic field resists change until an equally strong current is passed in the other direction. Thus, for example, the magnetic field of a ferrite with positive polarity can be reversed by applying a sufficiently strong negative current.\n\n[![Wikipedia Magnetic Core Memory photo - RF Cafe](https://www.rfcafe.com/references/popular-electronics/images4/Magnetic-Core-Memory-wikipedia.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-core_memory)\n\nWikipedia Magnetic Core Memory photo\n\nIn computers, this physical fact forms the basis of a memory system. The ferrites are shaped into doughnut-like rings, called toroidal cores, which are wired together in checkerboard \"matrices.\" A pair of wires, one horizontal and one vertical, intersect at each core. To store an electronic \"bit,\" it is only necessary to apply a polarizing voltage to the pair of wires meeting at a certain core. The magnetic field of that particular core will then shift and hold its new polarity, i.e., it will hold one \"bit\" of pulse-type information. None of the other cores will be affected, since the current in any one wire is not strong enough to reverse the cores' polarity. Only at the intersection point of the two pulsed wires, i.e., at the desired core location, do the two currents summate and thus achieve sufficient strength to evoke magnetic response.\n\nMagnetic core memory is the current favorite among computer engineers. The reasons are easy to see. To \"read out\" the information stored in the core memory requires no more time than it takes to send a \"sensing\" pulse along the diagonal lines to pick up the pattern of magnetic shifts. Six characters can be transferred into or out of the memory in about 20-millionths of a second. At this rate of figuring, the answers come up fast.\n\nHere, with the most advanced of memory devices, we are actually closest to my erstwhile piece of string with the knots tied in it. We may quite literally think of the pulsing wires as strings and of the magnetized cores as the knots. The magnetizing pulses \"tie\" the knots, and the sensing pulses \"feel along\" the string to locate the knots.\n\nOf course, my string didn't know the meaning of the knots. Only I did. Neither does the machine mind know the meaning of its memories. Only the creative mind of a human being is able to translate pulses, \"bits,\" characters, or even words and numbers into the kind of living sense from which men build their world.","x":-637,"y":-264,"width":350,"height":196},

The document described the concept of a stored-program computer, where both the program and data are stored in the same memory, which is now known as the [Von Neumann architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture \"Von Neumann architecture\"); it briefly explains the idea that computer instructions, or the program, could be stored in the same memory as the data, allowing for flexibility and automation in computation.\n\nLater in August 1946, when Wilkes participated in the final weeks of the [Moore School Lectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_School_Lectures \"Moore School Lectures\"), he was exposed to the principles of the [ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC \"ENIAC\") – Eckert and Mauchly's previous invention – and their proposed next project, the EDVAC.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-EDSAC_DEV-8) He proposed the concept of microprogramming, a system that simplifies the logical design of computers, which later became widely adopted in the industry. Using the knowledge he gathered about the EDVAC's working concept in the lectures, he began development of the EDSAC I in October of that year.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-10)\n\n## Technical overview\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=EDSAC&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Technical overview\")]\n\n### Physical components\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=EDSAC&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Physical components\")]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/EDSAC_%285%29.jpg/250px-EDSAC_%285%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EDSAC_\\(5\\).jpg)\n\n9-inch tubes used for monitoring\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/EDSAC_%2820%29.jpg/250px-EDSAC_%2820%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EDSAC_\\(20\\).jpg)\n\nWilliam Renwick with 5-hole tape reader and Creed teleprinter\n\nAs soon as EDSAC was operational, it began serving the university's research needs. It used [mercury delay lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-line_memory \"Delay-line memory\") for memory and [derated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derating \"Derating\") [vacuum tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube \"Vacuum tube\") for logic. Power consumption was 11 [kW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt \"Kilowatt\") of electricity.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-autogeneratedcl-12) Cycle time was 1.5 ms for all ordinary instructions, 6 ms for multiplication. Input was via five-hole [punched tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_tape \"Punched tape\"), and output was via a [teleprinter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter \"Teleprinter\").\n\nInitially, registers were limited to an [accumulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulator_\\(computing\\) \"Accumulator (computing)\") and a multiplier register. In 1953, [David Wheeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wheeler_\\(computer_scientist\\) \"David Wheeler (computer scientist)\"), returning from a stay at the [University of Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana%E2%80%93Champaign \"University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign\"), designed an [index register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_register \"Index register\") as an extension to the original EDSAC hardware.\n\nA magnetic-tape drive was added in 1952 but never worked sufficiently well to be of real use.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-autogeneratedcl-12)\n\nUntil 1952, the available main memory (instructions and data) was only 512 18-bit words, and there was no backing store.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-13) The delay lines (or \"tanks\") were arranged in two batteries providing 512 words each. The second battery came into operation in 1952.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-autogeneratedcl-12)\n\nThe full 1024-word delay-line store was not available until 1955 or early 1956,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-14) limiting programs to about 800 words until then.\n\nJohn Lindley (diploma student 1958–1959) mentioned \"the incredible difficulty we had ever to produce a single correct piece of paper tape with the crude and unreliable home-made punching, printing and verifying gear available in the late 50s\".[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-15)\n\n### Memory and instructions\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=EDSAC&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Memory and instructions\")]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/EDSAC_%289%29.jpg/250px-EDSAC_%289%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EDSAC_\\(9\\).jpg)\n\n[Maurice Wilkes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Wilkes \"Maurice Wilkes\") inspecting the mercury [delay line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-line_memory \"Delay-line memory\") of the EDSAC in construction\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/EDSAC_%2812%29.jpg/250px-EDSAC_%2812%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EDSAC_\\(12\\).jpg)\n\nMaurice Wilkes and Bill Renwick in front of the complete EDSAC\n\nThe EDSAC's main memory consisted of 1024 locations, though only 512 locations were initially installed. Each contained 18 bits, but the topmost bit was always unavailable due to timing problems, so only 17 bits were used. An instruction consisted of a five-bit instruction code, one spare bit, a 10-bit operand (usually a memory address), and one length bit to control whether the instruction used a 17-bit or a 35-bit operand (two consecutive words, [little-endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness \"Endianness\")). All instruction codes were by design represented by one mnemonic letter, so that the _Add_ instruction, for example, used the EDSAC character code for the letter A.\n\nInternally, the EDSAC used [two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement \"Two's complement\") [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number \"Binary number\") numbers. Numbers were either 17 bits (one word) or 35 bits (two words) long. Unusually, the [multiplier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_multiplier \"Binary multiplier\") was designed to treat numbers as [fixed-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic \"Fixed-point arithmetic\") fractions in the range −1 ≤ _x_ < 1, i.e. the binary point was immediately to the right of the sign. The [accumulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulator_\\(computing\\) \"Accumulator (computing)\") could hold 71 bits, including the sign, allowing two long (35-bit) numbers to be multiplied without losing any precision.\n\nThe instructions available were:\n\n- Add\n- Subtract\n- Multiply-and-add\n- AND-and-add (called \"Collate\")\n- Shift left\n- Arithmetic shift right\n- Load multiplier register\n- Store (and optionally clear) accumulator\n- Conditional goto\n- Read input tape\n- Print character\n- Round accumulator\n- No-op\n- Stop\n\nThere was no division instruction (but various division subroutines were supplied) and no way to directly load a number into the accumulator (a \"Store and zero accumulator\" instruction followed by an \"Add\" instruction were necessary for this). There was no unconditional jump instruction, nor was there a procedure call instruction – it had not yet been invented.\n\n[Maurice Wilkes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Wilkes \"Maurice Wilkes\") discussed relative addressing modes for the EDSAC in a paper published in 1953. He was making the proposals to facilitate the use of [subroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine \"Subroutine\").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-16)\n\n### System software\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=EDSAC&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: System software\")]\n\nThe _initial orders_ were hard-wired on a set of [uniselector switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepping_switch \"Stepping switch\") and loaded into the low words of memory at startup. By May 1949, the initial orders provided a primitive relocating [assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language_assembler \"Assembly language assembler\") taking advantage of the mnemonic design described above, all in 31 words. This was the world's first assembler, and arguably the start of the global software industry. There is a simulation of EDSAC available, and a full description of the initial orders and first programs.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-17)\n\nThe first calculation done by EDSAC was a program run on 6 May 1949 to compute [square numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number \"Square number\").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-:0-18) The program was written by [Beatrice Worsley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrice_Worsley \"Beatrice Worsley\"), who had travelled from Canada to study the machine.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-19)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-:0-18)\n\nThe machine was used by other members of the university to solve real problems, and many early techniques were developed that are now included in operating systems.\n\nUsers prepared their programs by punching them (in assembler) onto a paper tape. They soon became good at being able to hold the paper tape up to the light and read back the codes. When a program was ready, it was hung on a length of line strung up near the paper-tape reader. The machine operators, who were present during the day, selected the next tape from the line and loaded it into EDSAC. This is of course well known today as job queues. If it printed something, then the tape and the printout were returned to the user, otherwise they were informed at which memory location it had stopped. Debuggers were some time away, but a [cathode-ray tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube \"Cathode-ray tube\") screen could be set to display the contents of a particular piece of memory. This was used to see whether a number was converging, for example. A loudspeaker was connected to the accumulator's sign bit; experienced users knew healthy and unhealthy sounds of programs, particularly programs \"hung\" in a loop.\n\nAfter office hours certain \"authorised users\" were allowed to run the machine for themselves, which went on late into the night until a valve blew – which usually happened according to one such user.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-20) This is alluded to by [Fred Hoyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hoyle \"Fred Hoyle\") in his novel _[The Black Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Cloud \"The Black Cloud\")_\n\n### Programming technique\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=EDSAC&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Programming technique\")]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/EDSAC_%2823%29.jpg/250px-EDSAC_%2823%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EDSAC_\\(23\\).jpg)\n\nEDSAC monitoring desk[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-21)\n\nThe early programmers had to make use of techniques frowned upon today—in particular, the use of [self-modifying code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-modifying_code \"Self-modifying code\"). As there was no index register until much later, the only way of accessing an array was to alter which memory location a particular instruction was referencing.\n\n[David Wheeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wheeler_\\(computer_scientist\\) \"David Wheeler (computer scientist)\"), who earned the world's first Computer Science PhD working on the project, is credited with inventing the concept of a subroutine. Users wrote programs that called a routine by jumping to the start of the subroutine with the [return address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_statement \"Return statement\") (i.e. the location-plus-one of the jump itself) in the accumulator (a [Wheeler Jump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeler_Jump \"Wheeler Jump\")). By convention the subroutine expected this, and the first thing it did was to modify its concluding jump instruction to that return address. Multiple and nested subroutines could be called so long as the user knew the length of each one in order to calculate the location to jump to; [recursive calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_\\(computer_science\\) \"Recursion (computer science)\") were forbidden. The user then copied the code for the subroutine from a master tape onto their own tape following the end of their own program. (However, [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing \"Alan Turing\") discussed subroutines in a paper of 1945 on design proposals for the NPL [ACE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Computing_Engine \"Automatic Computing Engine\"), going so far as to invent the concept of a return-address stack, which would have allowed recursion.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-FOOTNOTETuring1945reprinted_in_Copeland_\\(2005\\),_p._383-22))\n\nThe lack of an index register also posed a problem to the writer of a subroutine in that they could not know in advance where in memory the subroutine would be loaded, and therefore they could not know how to address any regions of the code that were used for storage of data (so-called \"pseudo-orders\"). This was solved by use of an initial input routine, which was responsible for loading subroutines from punched tape into memory. On loading a subroutine, it would note the start location and increment internal memory references as required. Thus, as Wilkes wrote, \"the code used to represent orders outside the machine differs from that used inside, the differences being dictated by the different requirements of the programmer on the one hand, and of the control circuits of the machine on the other\".[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-23)\n\nEDSAC's programmers used special techniques to make best use of the limited available memory. For example, at the point of loading a subroutine from punched tape into memory, it might happen that a particular constant would have to be calculated, a constant that would not subsequently need recalculation. In this situation, the constant would be calculated in an \"interlude\". The code required to calculate the constant would be supplied along with the full subroutine. After the initial input routine had loaded the calculation-code, it would transfer control to this code. Once the constant had been calculated and written into memory, control would return to the initial input routine, which would continue to write the remainder of the subroutine into memory, but first adjusting its starting point so as to overwrite the code that had calculated the constant. This allowed quite complicated adjustments to be made to a general-purpose subroutine without making its final footprint in memory any larger than had it been tailored to a specific circumstance.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-24)\n\n### Application software\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=EDSAC&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Application software\")]\n\nThe subroutine concept led to the availability of a substantial subroutine library. By 1951, 87 subroutines in the following categories were available for general use: [floating-point arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic \"Floating-point arithmetic\"); arithmetic operations on [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number \"Complex number\"); checking; division; [exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation \"Exponentiation\"); routines relating to functions; [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation \"Differential equation\"); special functions; [power series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_series \"Power series\"); [logarithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm \"Logarithm\"); miscellaneous; print and layout; [quadrature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration \"Numerical integration\"); read (input); _n_th root; [trigonometric functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions \"Trigonometric functions\"); counting operations (simulating [repeat until loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_while_loop \"Do while loop\"), [while loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop \"While loop\") and [for loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop \"For loop\")); [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_vector \"Probability vector\"); and [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_\\(mathematics\\) \"Matrix (mathematics)\").\n\nThe first [assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language \"Assembly language\") appeared for the EDSAC, and inspired several other assembly languages:\n\n|Year|Name|Chief developer, company|\n|---|---|---|\n|1951|Regional Assembly Language|[Maurice Wilkes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Wilkes \"Maurice Wilkes\")|\n|1951|[Whirlwind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlwind_\\(computer\\) \"Whirlwind (computer)\") assembler|Charles Adams and Jack Gilmore at [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\")|\n|1951|Rochester assembler|[Nat Rochester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Rochester_\\(computer_scientist\\) \"Nathaniel Rochester (computer scientist)\")|\n\n## Applications of EDSAC\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=EDSAC&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Applications of EDSAC\")]\n\nEDSAC was designed specifically to form part of the Mathematical Laboratory's support service for calculation.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-25) [Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher \"Ronald Fisher\"), in collaboration with Wilkes and Wheeler, used EDSAC to solve a differential equation relating to gene frequencies; this represented the first application of a computer to research in [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology \"Biology\").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-26)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-27) In 1951, Miller and Wheeler used the machine to discover a 79-digit prime[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#cite_note-28) – the [largest known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_known_prime \"Largest known prime\") at the time.\n\nThe winners of three Nobel Prizes – [John Kendrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kendrew \"John Kendrew\") and [Max Perutz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Perutz \"Max Perutz\") (Chemistry, 1962), [Andrew Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Huxley \"Andrew Huxley\") (Medicine, 1963) and [Martin Ryle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Ryle \"Martin Ryle\") (Physics, 1974) – benefitted from EDSAC's revolutionary computing power. In their acceptance prize speeches, each acknowledged the role that EDSAC had played in their research.\n\nIn the early 1960s [Peter Swinnerton-Dyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Swinnerton-Dyer \"Peter Swinnerton-Dyer\") used the EDSAC computer to calculate the number of points modulo _p_ (denoted by _Np_) for a large number of primes _p_ on elliptic curves whose rank was known. Based on these numerical results, [Birch & Swinnerton-Dyer (1965)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC#CITEREFBirchSwinnerton-Dyer1965) conjectured that _Np_ for a curve _E_ with rank _r_ obeys an asymptotic law, the [Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch_and_Swinnerton-Dyer_conjecture \"Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture\"), considered one of the [top unsolved problems in mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems \"Millennium Prize Problems\") as of 2024.\n\n> The \"brain\" [computer] may one day come down to our level [of the common people] and help with our income-tax and book-keeping calculations.
